# Exploratory Data Mining

A machine learning project exploring unsupervised clustering techniques on a credit card dataset using Python, NumPy, and scikit-learn. The project implements K-Means and Bisecting K-Means from scratch, compares them against Scikit-learn, and analyzes customer segments.

Developed for CMPSC 432: Exploratory Data Mining at Penn State.

## Features

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- Data standardization and Min-Max normalization
- Custom implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm
- Custom implementation of Bisecting K-Means clustering
- Cluster evaluation using Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)
- Cluster profiling and comparison with Scikit-learn K-Means

## Main Components

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- PCA dimensionality reduction
- K-Means clustering implementation
- Bisecting K-Means implementation
- Cluster evaluation and visualization
- Cluster analysis and interpretation

## File Structure

- `credit-cards-kmeans-clustering.ipynb` – Complete clustering implementation and analysis (my work)
- `credit_cards_2025-post.csv` – Credit card dataset
- `Credit Card K-Means and Clustering Report.pdf` – Summary of methodology and results (my work)

## How to Run

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
jupyter notebook credit-cards-kmeans-clustering.ipynb
```
